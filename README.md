# CS 319 Project: Classroom Helper
## Description
This project will be a web application using Java programming language. 
There will also be a database where we can keep track of the users and other 
related futures that need to be saved and will be used in the future. 
We may further use SQL type of programming languages for the database.

### Features
- “Student” roles and “Instructor” roles
  - Log in as Student or Log in as Instructor.
  - Student role will include students.
  - Instructor roles will include both the class instructor and TAs. 
  - Instructor can create a class and the program will give an access code to the instructor which enables the instructor to invite his students to class (Invitation code).
- Group formation
  - After Student registers in the class, s/he can click on the form group button and then can send requests to a student to form a group by looking at the student list. If one of the students accepts his/her request, then they can form a group. 
  - For those who don’t have a group can send a request to any of the uncompleted groups (max group number will be determined by instructor). If the group accepts the request then the student joins that group. Also, the group can send invitations to individual students without the group. 
  - If a student won’t get any request or does not send any request, then the instructor will randomly assign that student into a group.
  - There will be a chatting feature if students do not want to send requests. Students can also discuss team formations.
- Calendar for the students in class and for project groups
  - Group Calendar: Group members can plan their meetings, group assignments etc via Group Calendar.
  - Class Calendar: Instructors can modify this. Deadlines, quizzes, homeworks, office hours etc. can be announced via Class Calendar.
- Peer review
  - Peer review features will be activated by the instructor at the end of the project submission. 
  - Everyone can review those in the same group by filling a form. This form includes several scoring questions (Necessary).
  - Each student can review other groups’ projects by looking at the other group’s demos (Optional). If they want, they can fill a form that includes several scoring questions.
  - Only the “Student” role can do peer review (anonym) and only the “Instructor” role can see the results of the review.
- Dashboard
  - Instructors will have a dashboard where s/he can see each student’s homework submissions, information and can grade those. Also, this dashboard contains all the groups. Instructors can see each group’s submission and grade them. Instructors can open submissions for hw, quiz, project, etc. for either group or student dashboard. Instructors can give feedback to each student and group by their submission, and also students can ask and comment on that feedback as well in the follow-up discussions.
  - Each student page will have both group and personal dashboards. 
    - In the group dashboard, students can see their project’s development, grades, and submission buttons. There will also be the calendar’s minimized version in the dashboard for group members to see both upcoming, and overdue assignments. After the instructor gave feedback on the assignment or commented on that, group members can have follow-up discussion. All group members can see the progress of their project, the progress bar will grow each time the group submits an assignment. Members of the dashboard can see the grading of their assignments and a graphical representation of their project grades. This graphical representation will also include the average of those assignments for group members to see their statistics amongst all other groups.
    - In the student dashboard, each student can see their private messages and their minimized personalized calendar. Students can also see their own upcoming and overdue assignments. They can submit their hw, quiz etc. After instruction gave feedback to the assignment or commented on that, students can have follow-up discussion.
